Notes:
	The only custom behaviour not workin is User.most_expensive_ticket_bought_between
	this is because our model of tickets doesn't have the requirements necessary (dates)
	i tried to change the model but  it doesn't worked, that's why we created our local database without that parameter
	but we still got the migration AddTimeToTicketOrders, but left the ticket creation without time
